SQL - Claims data

Project Title: Legacy Insurance Data Modernization.

The Problem: "Legacy RPA systems produced inconsistent data formats across London and Birmingham offices."

The Solution: "I developed a SQL-based ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to standardize premiums, remove duplicates, and calculate regional risk."

Architecture : CSV -> SQL Transformation -> Data Insights.
